Custom Enchanting Mod
=======

A fully custom enchanting system for Minecraft built with NeoForge, designed to give players deep control over enchanting, disenchanting, and upgrade mechanics. This mod replaces the vanilla enchanting flow with a power-based system, modifier items, XP costs, and visual customization, while remaining fully server-safe and multiplayer compatible.

Features:
============
Custom Enchanting System
